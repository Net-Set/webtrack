      <div class="col-sm-7"><h2>Portfolio Website</h2><p>Creating a portfolio website is if the first step towards getting a potential employer’s attention and scoring a new job. However, in order to achieve that, you first need to make sure that you know how to design portfolio that stands out.

If you aren’t sure how to make an outstanding portfolio website, you’ve come to the right place.</p></div>
    </div>
     <div class="row" >
      <div class="col"><h2>Your Best Work Comes First</h2>
        <p>Portfolio websites offer thousands of portfolios for potential employers to choose from so you have to understand that not everybody is going to spend hours analyzing every last detail you’ve written down there.

In fact, according to Tony Haile of Chartbeat, you only have 15 seconds of your future employer’s attention to make a perfect first impression!

That being said, it is only logical that you have to put your best work first because if you don’t, there is a big chance it will go unnoticed.

Try putting yourself in the client’s shoes and create a portfolio that would catch your attention if you were the portfolio website visitor.

You can always search for some web design inspiration by checking out portfolio examples on a free portfolio website and you can even use a pre-made portfolio template which could be very helpful with your portfolio design.

One way or another, always make sure that your online portfolio clearly displays your best work first!

      <div class="col"><h2>Create a Portfolio that is Easy to Navigate</h2>
        <p>When you think about how to create a portfolio, you should always keep in mind that your portfolio has to be easy to navigate.

Creating categories and dividing your work into segments makes it much easier for a person browsing through a portfolio website to better understand your portfolio and the most important aspects of your work.

So before creating your free online portfolio, try visiting other portfolio sites to see both good and bad online portfolio examples and the categories people use most often to classify their work.

      <h2>Make Your Own Website</h2>
      <p>
        You can easily make your own website with the help of portfolio website templates, free website design, and website design inspiration you’ve collected so far.

However, you should also consider hiring one of the professional builders to make sure that you’ll end up with one of the best portfolio websites out there. Just keep in mind that hiring a pro comes with a price.

Find the best graphic design portfolio or the best web developer portfolio is the beginning or finding the right person to do a good job for you.

Also, you can always rely on other high-quality sites to provide some of that necessary web inspiration you need to make a website.

      <h2>You Need a Domain Name</h2>
      <p>If you want to build your website, you’re going to need your own domain name. It is not a must, but it will prove itself very helpful with your branding and marketing.

It also adds that little extra edge to your business and makes you seem more passionate about the work you do which automatically helps to build your credibility and creates an image of a trustworthy and strong brand, person, or company.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
      <p>If you truly want a top portfolio website, simply creating one isn’t enough. You also need to make sure that people can find it so optimizing it for search engines is a must!

Personal portfolio websites that are impossible to find on Google are mostly just a waste of your time and resources.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h2>Have Vision and Mission</h2>
      <p>Before you start creating your web portfolio, you should know your vision and mission, or at least the clear reason why you decided to create this portfolio in the first place.

Once you know what message you want your portfolio to send, you can start creating it. For example, interior design portfolio is not going to look the same as a graphic designer portfolio or web designer portfolio.

Know your clients, consider your objectives, and then build your portfolio accordingly.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h2>Choose Projects with Best Results
</h2>
      <p>When building your portfolio website, be selective. There is no need to list every single detail and ever insignificant project from your past.

Choose projects with best results and put them on display, preferably divide them into categories to make the portfolio more organized.

Don’t forget to put the emphasis on the type of projects you would prefer working on in the future!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h2>Tell the Story – Provide Context</h2>

      <p>Adding context to your website portfolio can be very helpful to present your work the right way. Don’t be afraid to tell the story behind your most successful projects and explain how the work was created.

Try finding portfolio website examples where case studies were used to explain the process of completing the work. Include client’s goals and explain how you managed to fulfill them by demonstrating your approach step by step.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h2>Introduce Yourself (Not Just Your Work)</h2>
      <p>When you plan your portfolio layout, don’t forget to include a concise bio to let the clients know you as well as your work. Include your best skills, experience, background, as well as some of your biggest accomplishments.

Having a good logo can also help you make a better first impression and stand out on a portfolio site. It is all a part of branding yourself which is very useful (if not necessary) in the long run.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <h2>
      Keep it Concise
    </h2>
    <p>Good presentation is everything. You should consider using portfolio templates to help you keep the design clean.

Keep your portfolio concise and simple, and make sure it is easy to navigate and accessible.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h2>Awards and Recommendation</h2>
      <p>Having good recommendations is always a big plus so if you can include any of the testimonials from the clients you had worked with in the past, you should always do that.

The same thing goes for awards and certification – put them on display as they will make you seem more trustworthy and reliable.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h2>Do Your Best
</h2>
      <p>Once you have a great portfolio online, it is not time to lay back and relax. On the contrary, the hardest work is yet to come.

If you want to be among the best, you have to do your absolute best to produce top-notch work at all times! Only the best work can attract the best clients so if that’s what you’re shooting for, you have to be willing to do some heavy lifting!</p>

      <h2>Ending thoughts on creating a portfolio website</h2>
<p>      Creating a portfolio website is a great step towards helping the potential clients find you and choose YOU in the sea of experts in your field, as well as towards promoting your work and displaying your success and abilities.

A well-made, creative portfolio makes all the difference between making a fine first impression a truly outstanding one.</p>
