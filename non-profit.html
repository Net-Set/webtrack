        In the same way that businesses need websites to be their online presence, nonprofits do as well. A nonprofit website is the easiest way for many potential donors to make donations and will be the first place many people look to learn more about a nonprofit and determine if they want to support it.

If you have or are considering starting a nonprofit, then building a website for your organization is a crucial step in proving your legitimacy and reaching more people. You can use it to promote the projects your organization tackles, encourage followers to take action, and for accepting donations.

           <h2>How to build a non-profit website (in 6 easy steps)</h2>
                        <p>As a non-profit organization, you likely don’t have a lot of time and money to spare. All the same, you want a website that’s attractive, functional, and easy to use. The following six steps will take you through the process of
                            creating this type of site quickly and cheaply.</p>
                        <h3>1. Choose a platform for your non-profit website</h3>
                        <p>The first thing you need to do is select a platform to build your website with. There are many choices, but they largely fall into three camps. You can develop a website from scratch, sign up for a website builder, or use a Content
                            Management System (CMS).</p>
                        <p>Unless you happen to have some talented developers already on board, creating a site from nothing is usually costly and time-intensive. <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/best-website-builder/">Website builders</a>, on the other
                            hand, and cheap and simple to use. However, they don’t offer much flexibility, nor do they give you much control over your site.</p>
                        <p>A CMS is the perfect middle ground. This type of platform is typically open-source, which means you can download the software and use it to build your non-profit website for free. What’s more, a quality CMS will provide an easy-to-use
                            interface that lets you customize your site without any technical know-how.</p>
                        <p>For a non-profit site, <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/why-you-should-use-wordpress/">we’d highly recommend WordPress</a>:</p>
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        <p>This CMS is beginner-friendly and has a <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/wordpress-community/">large community</a> willing to help whenever you run into difficulties. Most importantly for your non-profit website, it’s free and
                            won’t require you to hire a developer.</p>
                        <h3>2. Purchase a hosting plan and domain name</h3>
                        <p>WordPress may be free to use, but building your non-profit website involves a few small costs. You’ll need to <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/best-domain-registrars/">register a domain</a> name and select <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/types-of-wordpress-hosting-plans/">a hosting plan</a>.</p>
                        <p>The domain name is your site’s primary URL (i.e., <em>mynonprofitsite.org</em>). When <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-domain-name/">deciding on a domain name</a>, you&#8217;re best off naming the site after your
                            organization, or using a short, catchy phrase that summarizes your mission, as in <em>saveourlibraries.org</em>.</p>
                        <p>You’ll also need to <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/domain-extensions-guide/">choose a Top Level Domain (TLD)</a>, such as <em>.com</em> or <em>.net</em>. We’d highly recommend using <em>.org</em>, as people are still more likely
                            to trust non-profit organizations using this TLD. If your budget allows, however, you may also want to purchase the <em>.com</em> version of your domain name and redirect it to your site.</p>
                        <p>In order to get your site online, you’ll also need to sign up for a hosting plan, which is the &#8220;engine&#8221; that powers your site and makes it available to other people &#8211; <a href="https://bluehost.com/track/codeinwp"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluehost is a good option</a> when you&#8217;re just getting started. Another benefit of Bluehost is that it gives you a free domain name, which you can choose during the signup process.</p>
                        
                        <p>Bluehost will also help <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/how-to-install-wordpress/">install WordPress</a> for you, which means that you can get started customizing your website right away.</p>
                        <h3>3. Pick out a theme to style your site</h3>
                        <p>By this point, you should have a basic WordPress site up and running. Now, you&#8217;ll want to give it a design that showcases your non-profit&#8217;s mission. Fortunately, this is a task you can &#8216;fast track&#8217; by choosing
                            the right WordPress theme.</p>
                        <p>In a nutshell, <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your site&#8217;s theme</a> controls how your site looks and is visually structured. This means that even if you’re not a designer,
                            you can select the style and appearance you want.</p>
                        <p>What’s more, there are a lot of themes designed specifically for non-profit sites. This means the style, layout, and elements are customized to match the needs of organizations like yours. Some even come with multiple templates
                            or demo pages, each designed to match a particular type of non-profit organization.</p>
                        <p>You can choose from many free options in the WordPress Theme Directory, merely by searching for <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/search/non%20profit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">themes with the keyword “non profit”</a> (or
                            “nonprofit”):</p>
                        <p>
                            <noscript>
                          
                            </noscript>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have the budget, you may also want to check out some <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress?term=nonprofit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">premium non-profit themes</a> as they&#8217;re <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/free-or-premium-wordpress-themes/"><em>often</em> a little more flexible</a>.
                            General <a href="https://themeisle.com/wordpress-themes/business/">business themes</a> often work well, too.</p>
                        <h3>4. Build your site’s basic pages</h3>
                        <p>Once you’ve installed your chosen theme, you’ll want to take some time to customize it. This means adding your own imagery and branding, as well as tweaking the style and design to fit your organization. How you do this will vary
                            by theme, but the best place to start is by visiting <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/wordpress-customizer-how-to/">the WordPress Customizer</a> via your site&#8217;s dashboard:</p>
                        <p>
                           
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>Next, you&#8217;ll want to create the basic pages that will make up your website. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building a page</a> in WordPress is straightforward, and your theme will
                            probably give you plenty of demo content to work with. At a minimum, you’ll want to include the following pages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A home page that lets visitors know what your organization is all about (preferably with a strong mission statement and lots of visuals).</li>
                            <li>An easy-to-find <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/build-a-contact-page-on-wordpress/">contact page</a>, with multiple ways to get in touch.</li>
                            <li>One or more pages providing information about what your organization does and why it matters.</li>
                            <li>An &#8216;archive&#8217; page to host your blog or news updates.</li>
                            <li>A page featuring your organization’s key members or partners, with headshots and bios if possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Of course, don’t forget to add in <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/what-add-call-to-action-to-wordpress/">that vital CTA</a>. This could be a donate button, a newsletter sign-up form, or a volunteer application. Just make sure
                            it’s prominently placed and stands out from the rest of your site.</p>
                        <p>If you want a little bit more flexibility over how your pages look, a <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/wordpress-page-builders/">WordPress page builder plugin</a> will let you design your pages using a visual, drag-and-drop editor.</p>
                        <h3>5. Consider a donation plugin</h3>
                        <p>We mentioned that word &#8220;plugin&#8221; above. Whereas themes change how your site looks, plugins help you add functionality to your site.</p>
                        <p>You can find plugins for all sorts of things, but one of the most helpful for a non-profit site is a donation plugin. These plugins will help you accept donations and run fundraising campaigns. Beyond that, they will also help
                            you manage donors, including an easy-to-access database, as well as the ability to generate the tax forms donors need.</p>
                        <p>One of the most popular donation plugins is the GiveWP plugin:</p>

                        <h3>6. Optimize your site for search engines</h3>
                        <p>Last but not least, you&#8217;ll need to consider how people will find your non-profit website. Primarily, this will happen through search engines, which means carrying out some <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/get-started-with-wordpress-seo/">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a>.</p>
                        <p>This is essentially a <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/essential-seo-settings-wordpress/">collection of techniques</a> to help your site rank highly in search engines. What’s worth noting is that for a non-profit website (particularly
                            for a smaller, locally-based operation), ‘local SEO’ will likely play a significant role. This involves optimizing your site to show up in searches by people who are physically nearby.</p>
                        <p>To get started with optimizing your site, we’d recommend first installing the free Yoast SEO plugin on your site, and learning how to use it:</p>
