      <div class="col-sm-7"><h2>web portal website</h2><p>Web portals are often websites designed for internal purposes at a business, organization, or institution. They collect information in different formats from different sources into one place to make all relevant information accessible to the people who need to see it. They often involve a login and personalized views for different users that ensure the information that’s accessible is most useful to their particular needs.</p></div>

        <h2></h2>
        <p>WordPress is our CMS of choice for several reasons. It strikes a perfect mix between ease of use and customization potential, and you can use it to build most types of websites.

In particular, it’s ideal for website portals, which tend to include a broad mix of features. The easiest way to implement all those features is by using plugins. Let’s look at how that process works!</p>

        <h2>1: Download Crucial Plugins</h2>
        <p>Plugins are one of WordPress’ main selling points, because they enable you to implement almost any functionality you want. However, before you go looking for plugins, you’ll need to figure out what features you want your web portal to have.</p>
        <p>Let’s go over some basic functionality you may want to include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>An intranet, so visitors can log in and access private data</li>
          <li>A section to display news or the latest content you’ve published</li>
          <li>Weather widgets
</li> 
<li>Live chat, so you can answer visitor queries on the fly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s an eclectic mix of features, and building a portal that contains all of them would take time. Fortunately, plugins streamline the process.

Blogging functionality is built into WordPress, so that’s already covered. As for creating an intranet, there are 

several top-notch tools you can use. One of our favorites is called All-In-One Intranet, which enables you to create ‘hidden’ parts of your website for members only:</p>

        <h2>2: Choose a Theme for Your Portal</h2>
        <p>When it comes to choosing a WordPress theme, there are thousands of options. You’ll want to be sure the one you pick includes all the features you’ll need. Changing themes can be cumbersome and cause errors, so you need to get it right the first time.

There are two major categories of WordPress themes: niche themes and multipurpose themes. The former category includes themes that are designed to suit specific types of sites, such as blogs, news sites, online stores, and more.

Multipurpose themes, on the other hand, aim to provide you with the tools you need to put together almost any type of website. That way, you only need to learn how to use one theme, and you can apply it to numerous projects.

When creating website portals, we’re partial to multipurpose themes due to their flexibility. With the right multipurpose theme, you’ll be able to build a portal that includes all the features you want.


Still, we recommend that you check out several themes and try them on for size before making a decision. That way, it’s less likely that you’ll need to change themes any time soon.

    <h2>3: Build Your Portal’s Content</h2>
    <p>Once your website portal’s functionality is ready, and you have a theme in place, you’ll want to spend some time customizing its design. When that’s done, it’s time to get to work on the content you want to publish.

If you’d like to focus on news, for example, you can use WordPress’ built-in editor and get to work on your first posts. What to write is up to you, but know that WordPress provides you with all the tools you need to produce high-quality written content:</p>

    <h2>Does a Website Portal Enhance the Digital Experience?</h2>
    <p>Website portals are unique, in that they aim to satisfy a broad range of needs for as many visitors as possible. If someone wants to check up on the news, they can do so through your portal. It can also be used to find out about the weather, access private data, read social media posts, and so on.

All those possibilities make for a highly-engaging digital experience. If you think that you or your business can benefit from a website portal, then WordPress is the perfect platform to help you get the job done.</p>
